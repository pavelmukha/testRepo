Master test
Misha (Master) determines x,m
Dima (Dimatest) determines d
Nina (Ninatest) determines n
x + n = d + m
3d = m - 2n
3d + 1 = 10
5 - 6n = -7
6n = 5 + 7
6n = 12
n = 2

---

m = 3d + 2n
m = 3 x 3 + 2n
m = 9 + 2n
m =

---

3d = 10 - 1
3d = 9
d = 3

---

x = d + m - n
x = 3 + 9 + 2n - n
x = 12 + n
